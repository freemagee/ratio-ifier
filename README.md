Ratio-ifier!
============

Simple tool to calculate the ratio between a width and a height. The ratio can
then be locked to allow opposite dimensions to be scaled according to the ratio.

Why?
----

Built for personal use and to practice writing a small vanilla JavaScript app.
Seemed like it had limited enough scope for a simple app. Developing something
on the small scale can promote creativity, much like an artist forcing
themselves to draw negative space only.

Use!
